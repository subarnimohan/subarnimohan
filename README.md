## Hi there 👋

My name is Subarni. I have a Master's in Analytics from Massey University and a passion for tinkering with Data in my daily life. I have worked as a Data Associate with an MNC in the Energy space having gained skills in the areas of Data Analytics, Data Management, Data Modelling and Data Engineering. Before making the switch to the world of Data in 2020, I worked as a Consultant for a start-up in Singapore assisting clients with a seamless immigration to Singapore. My professional and educational experiences have enabled me to be a go-getter and one who is looking for opportunities to gain new skills and knowledge. Outside of work, you would either find me travelling, reading, shopping or crying over my favourite k-drama 'Crash Landing on You'.
